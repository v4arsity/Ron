Side note:You can only use loops and side functions.
Write a common function for 2 whole parameters: height and width. THEN prints a rectangle whose dimensions match
The parameters. Each character in the rectangle contains its distance from the circumference. Therefore, the characters in scope will be '1,' the characters
Adjacent to them will be '2,' etc. It can be assumed without testing that any of the parameters between 1 and 18.
For example, if the height is 6 and the width 9, then the output will be:
111111111
122222221
123333321
123333321
122222221
111111111
